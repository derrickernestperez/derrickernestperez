## About Me

I am a Computer Science student building practical experience in systems administration, enterprise infrastructure, identity management, automation, troubleshooting, and operational documentation.

My primary technical project is a Microsoft-based IT operations homelab that recreates responsibilities commonly handled by:

- Help Desk technicians
- Service Desk analysts
- Systems administrators
- Infrastructure support engineers
- Identity and Access Management analysts
- Microsoft 365 administrators
- Junior security operations analysts

The purpose of this repository is not simply to show that technologies were installed.

Each module demonstrates the complete operational lifecycle:

```text

        ↓
Architecture and Dependencies
        ↓
Implementation
        ↓

        ↓
Troubleshooting
        ↓
Security Review
        ↓
Automation and Reporting
        ↓
Operational Documentation
        ↓
Lessons Learned
```

My work focuses on understanding why a configuration exists, how to prove that it works, what can fail, how to investigate the failure, and how to document the resolution for future technicians.

# Selected Troubleshooting Scenarios

The lab includes problems I encountered and investigated rather than only successful configurations.

| Scenario | Investigation |
|---|---|
| IP connectivity worked but hostnames failed | Client DNS configuration, `nslookup`, DNS records, resolver cache, and DNS-server reachability |
| DHCP stopped servicing clients | DHCP Event ID 1046, Active Directory authorization, service status, and scope configuration |
| Group Policy did not apply | OU placement, GPO links, security filtering, `gpupdate`, and `gpresult` |
| User received Access Denied | Security-group membership, share permissions, NTFS permissions, and effective access |
| Mapped drive did not appear | GPO scope, item-level targeting, user context, and policy processing |
| Folder Redirection remained local | User policy scope, UNC-path access, permissions, and sign-in processing |
| Printer did not deploy | GPO processing, printer permissions, drivers, and Print Spooler status |
| Server appeared to use high CPU | Running processes, System Idle Process, sustained resource usage, and Performance Monitor |
| Unexpected server shutdown events appeared | Kernel-Power Event ID 41 and surrounding System log events |
| Honey-account activity was detected | Security log review, account events, PowerShell filtering, and alert generation |
| Domain controller, DNS, Kerberos, and PowerShell Remoting failed | VMware networking, IP reachability, DNS configuration, domain discovery, Kerberos, and WinRM |

One investigation began as a PowerShell Remoting authentication failure.

Further testing showed:

- Kerberos authentication failure
- Domain discovery failure
- DNS timeouts
- Failure to reach SRV01 by IP address

Direct connectivity testing eventually identified the underlying issue as a broken VMware network path between CLIENT01 and SRV01.

```text
PowerShell Remoting failure
        ↓
Kerberos authentication failure
        ↓
Domain discovery failure
        ↓
DNS timeout
        ↓
Direct IP connectivity test
        ↓
VMware network-path failure identified
        ↓
Virtual network communication restored
        ↓
DNS resolution validated
        ↓
Domain discovery validated
        ↓
Kerberos and WinRM validated
```

This reinforced an important troubleshooting principle:

```text
Fix the lowest failing layer first.
```

# Troubleshooting Methodology

I use a structured troubleshooting approach:

```text
See
  ↓
Think
  ↓
Examine
  ↓
Proceed
```

## See

Identify the actual symptoms.

- What failed?
- Who is affected?
- Which systems are involved?
- What error messages appeared?
- When did the issue begin?

## Think

Develop possible causes based on the evidence.

- Network connectivity
- DNS configuration
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Group Policy
- Service state
- Permissions
- Resource usage
- Recent configuration changes

## Examine

Collect technical evidence before changing the environment.

- PowerShell output
- Event Viewer logs
- Network tests
- DNS queries
- Group Policy reports
- Service status
- Process information
- Permission reports
- Configuration records

## Proceed

Apply the lowest-risk correction and validate the result.

```text
Observe
→ Hypothesize
→ Test
→ Correct
→ Validate
→ Document
```

# How I Document My Work

Each project is organized around a repeatable technical documentation model.

## 1. Business Requirement

What problem is being solved?

## 2. Technology and Architecture

Which systems, services, accounts, and dependencies are involved?

## 3. Implementation

How was the technology configured?

## 4. Validation

What evidence proves that the configuration works?

## 5. Troubleshooting

What failed, what symptoms appeared, and how was the issue investigated?

## 6. Root Cause

What was the actual underlying cause?

## 7. Security Review

What permissions, risks, controls, or security implications were considered?

## 8. Automation and Reporting

Which tasks were automated, and what reports were generated?

## 9. Operational Documentation

Can another technician understand, repeat, validate, and troubleshoot the work?

```text
Do not only show the configuration.

Show the reasoning,
the evidence,
the troubleshooting,
and the operational value.
```

# Documentation Standards

## Accuracy

Documentation is based on:

- Live PowerShell output
- Actual system configuration
- Real troubleshooting events
- Validated commands
- Saved technical evidence

## Security

The repository does not intentionally include:

- Authentication tokens
- Private keys
- Recovery secrets
- Sensitive production data

## Repeatability

Procedures include:

- Prerequisites
- Commands
- Expected results
- Validation steps
- Failure handling
- Escalation criteria

## Traceability

Changes are connected to:

- Infrastructure records
- Incidents
- Knowledge articles
- Procedures
- Reports
- Validation evidence

## Maintainability

Reusable templates and validation scripts help future documentation follow a consistent structure.

# What This Repository Demonstrates

This repository shows my ability to:

- Build and manage a Windows enterprise lab
- Deploy Active Directory infrastructure
- Administer users, groups, and policies
- Configure DNS and DHCP
- Manage file and print services
- Automate repetitive tasks with PowerShell
- Investigate service and performance issues
- Read and interpret Windows event logs
- Troubleshoot layered infrastructure failures
- Document incidents and root causes
- Create knowledge base articles
- Write repeatable operating procedures
- Record configuration changes
- Validate documentation programmatically
- Present technical work in a structured portfolio

---

# Key Lessons

```text
Installation is only the beginning.
```

A service must also be:

- Configured
- Secured
- Validated
- Monitored
- Troubleshot
- Documented
- Maintained

```text
The visible error may not be the root cause.
```

An authentication error may originate from:

- Network failure
- DNS failure
- Domain discovery failure
- Time synchronization
- Service availability
- Account configuration

```text
Fix the lowest failing layer first.
```

```text
A resolved incident becomes more valuable
when the resolution becomes reusable knowledge.
```

```text
A file existing does not mean
the documentation is complete.
```

```text
Do not assume.
Collect.
Validate.
Document.
```
